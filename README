#DSE - Dynamic Symbolic Execution for Python Programs

## Overview
DSE (Dynamic Symbolic Execution) is a tool designed to analyze and test Python programs by leveraging symbolic execution techniques. It helps detect potential issues such as deep recursions and infinite loops while providing structured execution insights.

## Features
- Symbolic execution of Python code
- Function entry point detection (defaults to `main()` or function matching filename)
- Supports time-limited execution to prevent infinite loops
- Iterations control for fine-grained analysis
- Stores results in an output folder for further analysis

## Prerequisites
Before installing DSE, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Ubuntu (or any Linux-based system)
- Python Version: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies:**
  - `git`
  - `virtualenv`
  - `z3`

## Installation
To install DSE, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/555shivv/DSE.git
cd DSE
```

### 2. Setup Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Execution Permissions
```bash
chmod +x dse_run.sh
```

## Usage
To execute the DSE tool, use the following command:

```bash
./dse_run.sh <python_file> [iterations]
```

### Parameters:
- `<python_file>`: The Python script to analyze.
- `[iterations]` (optional): Number of iterations for symbolic execution (default: `1`).

### Example Usage:
```bash
./dse_run.sh test_script.py 5
```

## Output
- The execution results will be displayed in the terminal.
- The results will also be saved in the `Results/` folder.

## Troubleshooting
### 1. **Permission Denied on `dse_run.sh`**
```bash
chmod +x dse_run.sh
```

### 2. **Virtual Environment Not Activated**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. **Python Not Found Error**
Ensure Python 3 is installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If not installed, run:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```
